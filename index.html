			<h2>Subtheme: Zoning and Housing Supply</h2>
			For this assignment, I particularly focus on housing zoning data across 153 Metro Boston municipalities from 2010. This data has a wide variety of information about ethnicity and age groups of individuals who reside in these communities, in addition to sizes and incomes of the households that are within single-family and other zones. I was particularly interested in exploring all three of the aspects above in order to determine the composition of these municipalities and determine whether a community designation as MBTA affects its internal composition. 
			As a result, I compiled the three questions below with a focus on zoning laws, municipality composition, the racial diversity of single-family communities, as well as the age levels of individuals across these areas.
			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li> Which municipalities have the highest percentages of single family zoning and why?</li>
				<li>Is there any particular ethnicity that is most likely to live in a single family home?</li>
				<li>Are younger populations more likely to live in single-family or other zones?</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>
			My motivation for Question #1 can be drawn from the <i>Living Little</i> background reading about increasing housing density in key suburbs of Boston – given the commentary about Accessory Dwelling Units, I wanted to ascertain the municipalities that would benefit the most from this type of housing. 
			<figure>

			</figure>
			With this graphic, we explicitly make the observation that rural areas seem to have a higher percentage of single family homes, especially in comparison to metropolitan areas (i.e. Boston). This trend is likely due to high mortgage rates, limited land availability, and worker scarcity, which are more pronounced in large cities. Nonetheless, with this visualization, the answer to the above becomes a bit unclear -- rural areas might be the best suited for other zoning due to large unit availability, but the housing density might not be high enough to justify this conversion.
			However, given the focus of this module on MBTA communities as well, I also wanted to determine whether the designation of a community under this category has any significant bearing on its proportion of single family homes. Specifically, do MBTA communities have fewer single family homes? 

			<figure>
				<img src="images/mbta_municipalities.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					# of MBTA Communities per in Municipalities with Single-Family Zones
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			With this visualization, we explicitly see that the answer to the above is yes: municipalities with a greater % of land that is zoned for single-family homes seem to have fewer MBTA communities (as designated by the color scale). Correspondingly, Boston (which has 0 single-family municipalities) has 42 MBTA communities. With this example, we can clearly determine that a community designation as MBTA has a clear effect on its zoning laws (aligning with legislation as well). Finally, given the financial burden associated with building single-family homes (and corresponding sociopolitical ramifications), I wanted to determine the income levels of these communities. Specifically, do communities with a higher proportion of single family homes tend to have lower income or higher income levels? We see the below:


			<figure>
				<img src="images/income_levels_less_10000.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					Percentage of Zones that are Single Family and with a Correspondence to Households with Income Levels <= $10000 (Size of bubble represents % of zones reserved for single-family, while color represents count of households)
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/income_levels_greater_200000.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					Percentage of Zones that are Single Family and with a Correspondence to Households with Income Levels >= $200000 (Size of bubble represents % of zones reserved for single-family, while color represents count of households)
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			As shown from the maps above, there does not exist an explicit correlation between single family home percentage and income. Rather, for certain municipalities (i.e. Boston), there is a significant number of both high-income and low-income families that do not live in single family homes (see color scale). As a result, we defer to the above visualization, which confirms that the MBTA communities are less likely to have single family homes.

			Question #2 is particularly motivated by the idea of exclusionary zoning, in which status and fiscal value are taken into consideration when constructing housing units. Although these zoning practices cite upholding socioeconomic status as a main reason, I was curious as to whether racial identity could have a confounding effect for certain minority groups. 
			<figure>
				<img src="images/percentage_within_ethnicity.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>

			</figure>
			With the graphic above, we particularly see housing preference among ethnicities. Specifically, while white, non-Hispanic, and Pacific Islander individuals are the most likely to reside in single-family homes, Asian, Black, Native American and Latino populations seemingly fall short. This finding aligns with the idea of downzoning to resist desegregation, effectively excluding minority populations from obtaining housing. To furthermore contextualize this idea, I also wanted to determine the racial composition of single-family zones and other zones (i.e. do other single-family zones have fewer minority populations than other zones?).

			<figure>

			</figure>
			With the graphics above, we note a few observations that are generally consistent with the theory above. There is a significantly greater percentage of white individuals who belong to single family households (calculated over the total populations described in the figure above) in comparison to other individuals. Although there is a greater proportion of Asian individuals who belong to these single-family households, the disparity between white and Asian populations is still significant, hinting to racial motivations in zoning regulations. We do see a similar trend in other zones as well, where white individuals constitute the greatest percentage of residents – however, there is a pronounced increase of Asian, Latino, and Black, and multi-race populations that reside in these units as well. As a result, we do see some correlations that can justify racially motivated zoning – however, there may be other confounding factors for these results as well, such as dataset imbalance.

			The third question is primarily motivated from my own experiences while growing up in the Bay Area – while multifamily zones were primarily dominated by older populations, younger populations flocked to cities (famously dominated by single family zones). The visualization below is motivated by a similar curiosity about trends in Boston – specifically, this graph captures the composition of all municipalities by age group, as correlated with single family home %.

			<figure>
				<img src="images/age.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Age Makeup of all Residential Zones Correlated with Single-Family Percentage
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			This visualization demonstrates the age makeup of residential zones in this data. With this particular graph, we do not see any clear correlations between age group and corresponding likelihood of living in a single-family home. We primarily observe smaller relative proportions of younger age groups (18 and under and 18-64) in the population makeup, especially in comparison to the oldest age group. Although there seems to be a general sparsity of points for communities with a lower single family %, this observation can primarily be attributed to the dataset. Some conjectures are as follows:
			<ol>
				<li>The youngest age group (18 and under) demonstrates a relatively equal distribution of points across high and low single-family percentage ranges
				</li>
				<li>
					The subsequent age group (18-64) seems to have a slightly higher concentration of points corresponding to municipalities with a greater percentage of single-family homes. This correlation could likely be due to the formation of nuclear families and a necessity for long-term stability. 
				</li>
				<li>
					We also see a marginally higher density of points corresponding to the 65+ age group for areas that have more single-family homes. This observation may reflect a greater presence of stable, long-term neighborhoods in these municipalities or lower turnover rates.
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p>Overall, the visualizations above demonstrate a portfolio of stories about the racial, age-based, and geographic compositions of municipalities in Boston. With the above, we can ascertain information about short-term vs. long-term neighborhoods, signs of exclusionary zoning, and regulations that may differ across rural and metropolitan areas.</p>
